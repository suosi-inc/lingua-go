// By default, Lingua returns the most likely language for a given input text.
// However, there are certain words that are spelled the same in more than one
// language. The word `prologue`, for instance, is both a valid English and
// French word. Lingua would output either English or French which might be
// wrong in the given context. For cases like that, it is possible to specify a
// minimum relative distance that the logarithmized and summed up probabilities
// for each possible language have to satisfy. It can be stated as seen below.
//
// Be aware that the distance between the language probabilities is dependent on
// the length of the input text. The longer the input text, the larger the
// distance between the languages. So if you want to classify very short text
// phrases, do not set the minimum relative distance too high. Otherwise Unknown
// will be returned most of the time as in the example below. This is the return
// value for cases where language detection is not reliably possible.

	// Output:
	// Unknown
	// false
}

// Knowing about the most likely language is nice but how reliable is the
// computed likelihood? And how less likely are the other examined languages in
// comparison to the most likely one? In the example below, a slice of
// ConfidenceValue is returned containing all possible languages sorted by their
// confidence value in descending order. The values that this method computes are
// part of a relative confidence metric, not of an absolute one. Each value is a
// number between 0.0 and 1.0. The most likely language is always returned with
// value 1.0. All other languages get values assigned which are lower than 1.0,
// denoting how less likely those languages are in comparison to the most likely
// language.
//
// The slice returned by this method does not necessarily contain all
// languages which the calling instance of LanguageDetector was built from.
// If the rule-based engine decides that a specific language is truly
// impossible, then it will not be part of the returned slice. Likewise,
// if no ngram probabilities can be found within the detector's languages
// for the given input text, the returned slice will be empty.
// The confidence value for each language not being part of the returned
// slice is assumed to be 0.0.

	// French: 0.79
	// German: 0.75
	// Spanish: 0.72
}

// By default, Lingua uses lazy-loading to load only those language models on
// demand which are considered relevant by the rule-based filter engine. For web
// services, for instance, it is rather beneficial to preload all language models
// into memory to avoid unexpected latency while waiting for the service response.
// If you want to enable the eager-loading mode, you can do it as seen below.
// Multiple instances of LanguageDetector share the same language models in
// memory which are accessed asynchronously by the instances.

// There might be classification tasks where you know beforehand that your language
// data is definitely not written in Latin, for instance. The detection accuracy
// can become better in such cases if you exclude certain languages from the
// decision process or just explicitly include relevant languages.
